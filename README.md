#Naive Bayes Quantifier
This is a project for CS2023 Python Programming, aimed at teaching students how to make a Naive Bayes Quantifier. This project uses machine learning concepts, giving the program a list of messages labeled with either spam or ham. The project then learns from this dataset and uses the statistical data to re-read this dataset and predict whether the message is spam or ham.

This github repo includes all the necessary library elements for the program to work. Main.py is included in .venv
