# CS2023--NaiveBayesQuantifier
This is a project for CS2023 Python Programming, aimed at teaching students how to make a Naive Bayes Quantifier. This project uses machine learning concepts, giving the program a list of messages labeled with either spam or ham. The project then learns from this dataset and uses the statistical data to re-read this dataset and predict whether the message is spam or ham.
